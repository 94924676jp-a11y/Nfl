## 2026-09-10 — OUT-001: retain `status` in the reduced weekly-roster vintage

**Why.** `p4c_params.class_point_forecast` returns a share conditional on a
player appearing; the allocator consumes it as an unconditional weight over the
roster it is handed. The historical fitting panel holds 14.6 WR/TE/RB per
team-game summing to 1.24; the prospective full roster holds 22.5 summing to
2.14, which halves every starter share. Of 45 SF/LA WR/TE/RB roster rows, 29
are ACT, 10 DEV, 3 RES and 3 CUT.

**What is missing.** The raw nflverse `weekly_rosters_2026.csv` carries
`status` (ACT/DEV/RES/CUT/EXE) and `depth_chart_position`. The vintage
reduction keeps only `season, week, team, gsis_id, position`, so both are
captured and then discarded. Only one raw roster blob is retained locally
(`weekly_rosters.5ec59c5228198f57.csv`, observed 2026-09-06T18:50:51Z).

**Request.** Add `status` and `depth_chart_position` to the reduced roster
columns from the next capture onward. This is a capture-layer change and was
deliberately not made from here.

**Consequence if not done.** The R5 repair can only run against a capture whose
raw blob happens to be retained, and refuses by name
(`ROSTER_STATUS_UNAVAILABLE`) otherwise.

## 2026-09-10 — OUT-002: historical weekly-roster vintages carrying `status`

**Why.** R5 removes players who were never eligible to take a snap. The
historical corpus contains only players who APPEARED, so the contamination R5
removes does not exist in it and the counterfactual cannot be constructed. This
is why the audit reports distributional evidence rather than a per-game held-out
CRPS/PIT comparison, and says so.

**Request.** Weekly roster files for 2020–2025 with the `status` column, so a
historical team-game's full roster can be reconstructed and V1 versus R5 scored
per game against realised outcomes.

**Exact need.** `weekly_rosters_{season}.csv` for seasons 2020, 2021, 2022,
2023, 2024, 2025, from the nflverse `weekly_rosters` release, with `status`
retained.

## 2026-09-10 — OUT-003 (informational): egress works from this container

A request to the nflverse release endpoint returned HTTP 200 and 65,119 bytes
from this environment on 2026-09-10. The project has been treating egress as
universally 403 and `pbp_sources()` still returns BLOCKED. No source or
connector has been changed on the strength of this; it is recorded because it
changes what is genuinely blocked for both agents rather than assigned to one.

## 2026-09-10 — OUT-004: OUT-002 is PARTLY DISCHARGED from here, and by a different route

**What changed.** OUT-002 asked for historical weekly rosters carrying `status`
so a team-game's full roster could be reconstructed. The underlying need — a
denominator that contains players who did NOT appear — turns out to be
satisfiable from the depth chart instead, which lists a team's players whether
or not they play and is already committed and hash-verified for 2020–2024
(`nfl/research/inputs/dc_20{20..24}.csv.gz`, 152,246 entries).

Unioning the panel with the depth listing adds **6,181 player-team-weeks the
panel does not hold at all**, including listed rank-1 players who missed the
game. That is the censored mass OUT-002 was asking for.

**OUT-002 is NOT withdrawn.** The depth chart is a listing, not an eligibility
status: it cannot distinguish inactive from waived from practice-squad, and a
player off the chart with no panel row still produces no row, so the tail is
reduced rather than eliminated. `status` remains the better instrument and the
request stands at lower priority.

## 2026-09-10 — OUT-005: the 2025 depth-chart leaf was fetched from here

**What was done.** `depth_charts_2025.csv` (52,917,870 bytes, sha256
`f5a4aa3f…`) was fetched from the nflverse release endpoint on 2026-09-10 and
column-reduced to `nfl/research/inputs/dc25_daily.csv.gz` (146,246 rows, five
columns, every daily snapshot retained). Recorded in `INPUT_MANIFEST.json` with
the upstream URL, the full-file hash and the reduction rule.

**Why it matters to you.** This closes the 2025 hole in the depth feature —
`stage_a.depth()` defaults to `range(2020, 2025)` and returned nothing for
13,813 2025 panel rows. It also establishes that the 2025+ ESPN daily schema is
genuinely point-in-time: over the 544 team-weeks of the 2025 regular season,
every one resolves to a snapshot 6.3 to 18.7 hours before kickoff, median 10.8.

**What is still yours.** The two feeds do not overlap in time — nflverse weekly
ends after 2024, ESPN daily begins 2025-08 — so **no measurement in this
repository can establish that a 2024 "WR2" and a 2026 "WR2" mean the same
thing.** Measured appearance rate at rank 1 is 0.707–0.812 under the weekly feed
and 0.895–0.923 under the daily one, which is consistent with either a genuine
vendor difference or a genuinely fresher chart. If any archived ESPN daily depth
snapshot exists for a 2024-or-earlier week, it would settle this; nothing in
this checkout can.

## 2026-09-10 — OUT-006 (informational): `GAP-DEPTH-CHART-PIT` is overstated

`nfl/INFORMATION_GAP_REGISTRY.json` records `GAP-DEPTH-CHART-PIT` with
`proxy_adequacy: "good prospectively; ZERO historical as-of depth"` and
`action: PROSPECTIVE_ONLY`, on the basis that the project's vintage record
begins 2026-09-06. That is true of OUR capture and false of the source: the
upstream 2025 release carries the vendor's own daily `dt` series back to
2025-08-03, and the 2020–2024 weekly leaves are already committed. The registry
entry has been corrected rather than left standing.
