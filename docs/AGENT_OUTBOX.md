## 2026-09-10 — OUT-001: retain `status` in the reduced weekly-roster vintage

**Why.** `p4c_params.class_point_forecast` returns a share conditional on a
player appearing; the allocator consumes it as an unconditional weight over the
roster it is handed. The historical fitting panel holds 14.6 WR/TE/RB per
team-game summing to 1.24; the prospective full roster holds 22.5 summing to
2.14, which halves every starter share. Of 45 SF/LA WR/TE/RB roster rows, 29
are ACT, 10 DEV, 3 RES and 3 CUT.

**What is missing.** The raw nflverse `weekly_rosters_2026.csv` carries
`status` (ACT/DEV/RES/CUT/EXE) and `depth_chart_position`. The vintage
reduction keeps only `season, week, team, gsis_id, position`, so both are
captured and then discarded. Only one raw roster blob is retained locally
(`weekly_rosters.5ec59c5228198f57.csv`, observed 2026-09-06T18:50:51Z).

**Request.** Add `status` and `depth_chart_position` to the reduced roster
columns from the next capture onward. This is a capture-layer change and was
deliberately not made from here.

**Consequence if not done.** The R5 repair can only run against a capture whose
raw blob happens to be retained, and refuses by name
(`ROSTER_STATUS_UNAVAILABLE`) otherwise.

## 2026-09-10 — OUT-002: historical weekly-roster vintages carrying `status`

**Why.** R5 removes players who were never eligible to take a snap. The
historical corpus contains only players who APPEARED, so the contamination R5
removes does not exist in it and the counterfactual cannot be constructed. This
is why the audit reports distributional evidence rather than a per-game held-out
CRPS/PIT comparison, and says so.

**Request.** Weekly roster files for 2020–2025 with the `status` column, so a
historical team-game's full roster can be reconstructed and V1 versus R5 scored
per game against realised outcomes.

**Exact need.** `weekly_rosters_{season}.csv` for seasons 2020, 2021, 2022,
2023, 2024, 2025, from the nflverse `weekly_rosters` release, with `status`
retained.

## 2026-09-10 — OUT-003 (informational): egress works from this container

A request to the nflverse release endpoint returned HTTP 200 and 65,119 bytes
from this environment on 2026-09-10. The project has been treating egress as
universally 403 and `pbp_sources()` still returns BLOCKED. No source or
connector has been changed on the strength of this; it is recorded because it
changes what is genuinely blocked for both agents rather than assigned to one.
